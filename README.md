# ToDoList
  I created a notes app in JS as a web app. Users can add, edit and remove.

  Users can archive notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.

  There is also be a summary table which counts notes by categories: separately for active and archived. The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.
   In this app im used:
   JavaScript
        Import / export 
        Array methods: map, forEach, filter, splice, findIndex 
        Array spread operator
        Regular expressions

    DOM API
        document.querySelector
        document.addEventListener
        document.getElementById
